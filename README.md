## Abstract
Meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina) on the Isles of Scilly represent an ideal model in which to dissect the links between genotype, phenotype and long-term patterns of selection in the wild - a largely unfulfilled but fundamental aim of modern biology. To meet this aim, a clear description of genotype is required. Here we present the draft genome sequence of M. jurtina to serve as an initial genetic resource for this species. Seven libraries were constructed using pooled DNA from five wild caught spotted females and sequenced using Illumina, PacBio RSII and MinION technology. A novel hybrid assembly approach was employed to generate a final assembly with an N50 of 214 kb (longest scaffold 2.9 Mb). The genome encodes a total of 36,294 genes. 90.5% and 88.7% of core BUSCO(Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) Arthropoda and Insecta gene sets were recovered as complete single-copies from this assembly. Comparisons with 17 other Lepidopteran species placed 86.5% of the assembled genes in orthogroups.Our results provide the first high-quality draft genome and annotation of the meadow brown butterfly, Maniola jurtina.
